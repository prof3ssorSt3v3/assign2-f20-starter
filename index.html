      Import the data from the provided JS file by attaching both with `<script>` tags 
      and put the data script first.
      Add one more `Object `with the same properties to the `Array` in the data file. 
      Use your name for this new person object.
      Use the data to build a series of contact cards.
      Write a function that gets called after the `DOMContentLoaded` event which will
      loop through the Array from the data file and create a card that looks like 
      the sample one in the HTML. 
      The function must also remove the sample card before looping through your data
      to build the new cards. 
      Use the provided CSS. You can edit the contents of the provided CSS selectors. 
      There is no need to add more selectors. 
      Create your own colour-scheme and replace any instances of `rebeccapurple` with 
      a colour from your colour-scheme.
